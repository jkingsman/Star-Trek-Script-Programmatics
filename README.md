# Star-Trek-Script-Programmatics -- Machine Readable Star Trek Scripts!

A collection of Star Trek scripts dumped to JSON. A bit of a messy repo from my work but better the data be out there than not.

`dumps` are the raw complete transcript with limited speaker and locatio identification.

`processed` contains TNG and VOY scripts in cleaned JSON mode, grouped per episode.

`csv_dumps` contains a CSV for each show, each line containing episode and speaker identifiers.

`script converters` contains some of the raw scraping and enrichment logic used to create the script dumps, and is likely of little benefit to anyone that's not me regenerating these from scratch.

Fair warning, these scripts have typos due to conversion problems and the code to generate and wrangle them is poorly written and hastily slapped together -- please temper expectations (and know that I can code better than this when I want to).

Special thanks to http://www.chakoteya.net/; their dumps were the source for all this.
